Task 2: AI Chat Bot 

The project is to build a chat bot that can respond with proper answers to corresponding questions using its own intelligence through the trained data

We use python as scripting language and deep learning to train with the data

we use different modules like nltk, numpy, tflearn, random, json

We need to train using an extents.json file to input the responses, question patterns and then write the training, testing code in the main.py

rest of the model files are created automatically 

The code when runned asks questions and can give different responses even when same question is repeated due to random module, also returning a right response
